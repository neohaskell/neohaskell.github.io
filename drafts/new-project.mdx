# Create a New Project

Trying stuff in the REPL is cool and all that, but if you want to build something
that you can share with the world, you need to create a project.

## Generating a New Project

Let's run `neo help` one moment to see what commands are available:

```text
$ neo help
Neo: I'm here to help you.

     Usage: neo <command> [options]

     Commands:
       help      Show this help message
       version   Show version
       new       Create new things
       update    Update things
       build     Build things
       run       Run things
       watch     Run things on file changes
       clean     Clean the project
       install   Install a package
       uninstall Uninstall a package
       search    Search for a package
       list      List installed packages
```

Take a moment to read the description of each command. We're interested in creating
something new, so let's run `neo new help` to see what options are available:

```text
$ neo new help
Neo: The `new` command is used to create new things.

      Usage: neo new:<command> [options]

      Commands:
        project Create a new project
        ...
```

Cool! We can create a new project. Let's run `neo new:project help` to see what it
can do:

```text
$ neo new:project help
Neo: The `new:project` command is used to create a new project.
I will ask the user questions about their project and generate
a project based on the answers. You can always skip the
questions by passing the options directly.

      Usage: neo new:project <project-directory> [options]

      Options:
        --version      -v    Project version
        --author       -a    Project author
        --license      -l    Project license
        --no-git-init  -G    Skip Git init
```

Let's go ahead and create a new project by running `neo new:project`:

```text
$ neo new:project learning-neohaskell
Neo: I will ask you a few questions about your project.
     Press enter to select the default value (in brackets).

? Project name (Learning NeoHaskell):
? Project version (0.1.0):
? Project author:
? Project license (MIT):
? Skip Git init [y/N]: No

Neo: Creating project...
     Project created!
```

After a while, Neo will create a new project for you, in the directory
specified after the command. Let's take a look at the project structure:

```text
learning-neohaskell
├── .vscode
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── neo.yaml
├── src
│   └── App
│   │   └── ToDo.hs
│   └── Main.hs
└── test
    └── App
    │   └── ToDo.hs
    └── Main.hs
```

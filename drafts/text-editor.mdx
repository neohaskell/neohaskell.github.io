# Using a Text Editor

An alternative to typing everything into Neo's REPL is to use a text editor to write your code.

You can use any text editor you like, but we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is the most popular editor according to [StackOverflow's 2023 survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/#most-popular-technologies-new-collab-tools), and therefore the NeoHaskell
team ensures that it is well integrated, given that the interaction
user-editor is a key part of the development experience, and therefore has
to be as smooth as possible.

If for any reasons, you dislike Visual Studio Code, you can use any other editor you like. However, you will have to figure out how to set it up yourself. There's a 100% open source alternative to Visual Studio Code
called [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) that _might_ support the
NeoHaskell extensions.

## Installing the NeoHaskell Extension Pack

Usually, when opening a NeoHaskell project in Visual Studio Code, it will
prompt you to install the recommended extensions. <Badge issue="73"/>

For now, we won't be delving deep into all the details of creating a new
NeoHaskell project, as this page just serves as a guide for you for the
case if you prefer writing your code in a text editor instead of in the REPL. So we will install the NeoHaskell extension pack manually. <Badge issue="74"/>

You can install the NeoHaskell extension pack by following these steps:

- Open up Visual Studio Code
- Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (on MacOS)
  - or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (on Windows/Linux)
- Type `Extensions: Install Extensions` and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>
- Search for `NeoHaskell` in the search bar
- Click on the `NeoHaskell extension pack` extension
- Click on the `Install` button

## Printing stuff

Create a new file using the `File > New File` menu item, and save it as
`UsingTextEditor.hs`.

:::caution
Throughout the docs, you will see code snippets like the following, where
there are two tabs, one called NeoHaskell and one called TypeScript. The
NeoHaskell tab **contains the code that you should type into your file**, and
the TypeScript tab **serves as a counter example** to help you anchor into your
existing knowledge of programming. You can click on the tabs to switch
between them, and see how they compare.
:::

In the file, type the following:

<Tabs groupId="lang">
<TabItem value="nh" label="NeoHaskell">

```haskell
main = do
  print "Hello World!"
  print "I'm using a text editor!"
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">

```ts
const main = () => {
  console.log("Hello World!");
  console.log("I'm using a text editor!");
};
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

In NeoHaskell, all programs begin with a `main` function. This is tells
NeoHaskell where to start executing your program. The `do` keyword is
used delimit a _block_ of code, similar to how curly braces are used in
languages like TypeScript, but here we use indentation instead.

To run this, you can either do it from the console, or from within Visual
Studio Code.

### Running from the console

To run this from the console, open your terminal, and navigate to the
directory where you saved the file. Then, run the following command: <Badge issue="75"/>

```text
$ neo run UsingTextEditor.hs
Hello World!
I'm using a text editor!
```

### Running from Visual Studio Code

To run this from Visual Studio Code, open the file, and press

- <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (on MacOS)
- or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⇧</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> (on Windows/Linux)

and type `NeoHaskell: Run Current File`. <Badge issue="76"/>

The `OUTPUT` tab should open up, and you should see the output of your
program there:

```text
Hello World!
I'm using a text editor!
```

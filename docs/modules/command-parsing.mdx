# Building Command-Line Interfaces

Most programs we write do something. And a lot of the time, we want to **ask the user what they want to do** â€” maybe by passing a name, setting a path, or toggling a feature on or off.

Thatâ€™s where NeoHaskellâ€™s command-line parser comes in. It's clean, safe, and easy to use â€” and integrates perfectly with the rest of your application.

You describe what arguments you want, and NeoHaskell builds a structured object for you, automatically.

Letâ€™s see how.

## A Simple CLI: Hello, Whoever You Are!

Imagine weâ€™re writing a small tool. It greets someone. The user can give us their name, and ask us to shout it.

Hereâ€™s how we describe that in NeoHaskell.

```haskell
data GreetCommand = GreetCommand
  { name :: Text,
    isShouting :: Bool
  }
```

Thatâ€™s our data. A name (`Text`) and whether to shout (`Bool`).

Now the command parser:

```haskell
import Command qualified

greetParser : Command.OptionsParser GreetCommand
greetParser = do
  parsedName <- Command.text
            { help = "Name of the person to greet",
              long = "name",
              short = 'n',
              metavar = "NAME",
              value = Nothing
            }
  parsedShout <- Command.flag
                  { help = "Whether to shout the greeting",
                    long = "shout",
                    short = 's',
                    value = Nothing
                  }
  GreetCommand { name = parsedName, isShouting = parsedShout }
    |> Command.yield
```

So far, so good.

We just defined how to convert a few flags into something meaningful:

`GreetCommand { name = "Alice", isShouting = True }`

Now, we'd need a function to know how to run this command. We usually call these _handlers_:

```hs
handleCommand : GreetCommand -> Task Text Unit
handleCommand GreetCommand{name, isShouting} = do
  let baseGreeting = [fmt|Hello, {name}!|]
  let greeting =
        if isShouting then
          baseGreeting |> Text.toUpper
        else
          baseGreeting
  Console.print greeting
```

Afterwards, we'd need to modify our `run` function in order to parse the command and call the handler:

```hs
run : Task Text Unit
  cmd <- Command.parseHandler greetParser

  let onError err = [fmt|Oops, an error has occurred{e}|]
  handleCommand cmd
    |> Task.mapError onError
```

Try running the code with:

```bash
$ neo run -- --name Alice --isShouting
```

:::note
When running code with `neo run`, if your program receives command line arguments, you should write them
after two dashes like above. If not, `neo` will think that you are passing those to it.
:::

## Multiple Commands

Sometimes, you want more than one thing your program can do. Like `greet`, but also `wave` or `thank`.

You can define a data type that lists all possible commands:

```haskell
data Command
  = Greet GreetCommand
  | Wave WaveCommand
  | Thank ThankCommand
```

Each command has its own record:

```haskell
data GreetCommand = GreetCommand
  { name :: Text,
    isShouting :: Bool
  }

data WaveCommand = WaveCommand
  { emoji :: Text
  }

data ThankCommand = ThankCommand
  { name :: Text
  }
```

Now, letâ€™s write a parser for each one.

```haskell
greet : Command.CommandOptions Command
greet =
  { name = "greet",
    description = "say hello",
    version = Nothing,
    decoder = do
      name <- Command.text
        { help = "Who to greet",
          long = "name",
          short = 'n',
          metavar = "NAME",
          value = Nothing
        }
      isShouting <- Command.flag
        { help = "Whether to shout",
          long = "shout",
          short = 's',
          value = Nothing
        }

      -- Protip! If there's a variable in scope with the same name as the record field,
      -- you don't have to assign it. NeoHaskell will do it for you!
      GreetCommand { name, isShouting }
        |> Greet   -- Note how we're wrapping the type GreetCommand
                   -- into the Greet branch of the Command enum.
        |> Command.yield
  }
```

```haskell
wave : Command.CommandOptions Command
wave =
  { name = "wave",
    description = "wave silently",
    version = Nothing,
    decoder = do
      emoji <- Command.text
        { help = "Which emoji to use",
          long = "emoji",
          short = 'e',
          metavar = "EMOJI",
          value = Just "ðŸ‘‹"
        }
      WaveCommand { emoji }
        |> Wave   -- Same here
        |> Command.yield
  }
```

```haskell
thank : Command.CommandOptions Command
thank =
  { name = "thank",
    description = "thank someone",
    version = Nothing,
    decoder = do
      name <- Command.text
        { help = "Who to thank",
          long = "name",
          short = 'n',
          metavar = "NAME",
          value = Nothing
        }
      ThankCommand { name }
        |> Thank
        |> Command.yield
  }
```

Now combine them into a single parser:

```haskell
allCommands : Command.OptionsParser Command
allCommands =
  Command.commands [greet, wave, thank]
```

And finally run it:

```haskell
main : Task Text Unit
main = do
  userCommand <- Command.parseHandler
    { name = "hello-cli",
      description = "A friendly assistant",
      version = Just [version|1.0.0|],
      decoder = allCommands
    }
  let onError e = [fmt|Oops, something went wrong: {e}|])
  handle userCommand
    |> Task.mapError onError
```

## Handling the Commands

Once you've parsed a command, you can handle it however you want:

```haskell
handle : Command -> Task Text Unit
handle command =
  case command of
    Greet GreetCommand{name, isShouting} -> do
      let baseGreeting = [fmt|Hello, {name}!|]
      let greeting =
            if isShouting then
              baseGreeting |> Text.toUpper
            else
              baseGreeting
      Console.print greeting

    Wave WaveCommand{emoji} ->
      Console.print emoji

    Thank ThankCommand{name} ->
      Console.print [fmt|"Thanks, {name}!"|]
```

And thatâ€™s it! Now your CLI supports multiple commands, each with its own set of options, and a clean entrypoint to handle them.

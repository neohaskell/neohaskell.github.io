## Sprint Planning

NeoHaskell grows and thrives with the support of its amazing community! Below you'll find our sprint planning, complete with goals and GitHub issues. If you see something you'd like to help with, feel free to jump in by commenting on an issue or shooting a message over Discord. Every contribution, no matter how small, makes a difference!

<details>
  <summary><strong>Sprint 1: 2025/03/13 - 2025/03/27</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/orgs/neohaskell/projects/4/views/1">View on GitHub</a>)</summary>

  **Goals:**
  - [ ] Have an MVP of the `neo` CLI tool working

  **GitHub Issues:**
  - [x] [Issue #68](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/68) — Print always a message about reporting issue on command failure
  - [x] [Issue #126](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/126) — Move forEach from Array to Task to Avoid Cyclic Dependency
  - [x] [Issue #70](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/70) — All Neo (sub)commands should have a help command that explains how to use it properly
  - [x] [Issue #133](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/133) — Initialize projects with neo init
  - [x] [Issue #109](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/109) — CLI Command that allows running the project
  - [ ] [Issue #138](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/138) — Research how to provide a REPL using the Nix environment, rather than cabal - **SPILL OVER INTO NEXT SPRINT**
  - [ ] [Issue #114](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/114) — 'neo' is not available yet
  - [ ] [Issue #134](https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/134) — Create the installation script for the website

## Roadmap

The roadmap represents a rough view of the progress of the different
parts of the project. If one box is checked doesn't mean it is 100%
done, as software usually is an infinite work, it means that it is
usable, but always with room for improvement.

# Introduction

:::caution
The documentation that you're reading is a design document where most of
the features you're reading are yet to be implemented. The goal of the
documentation is to serve as a guiding point to the implementation of the
language.

## What is NeoHaskell?

NeoHaskell is a language for building and maintaining applications with the minimal amount
of headaches possible. It builds on top of industrial-grade tools like GHC to allow developers of any level to be productive in a wide range of fields.
It compiles to native code, and runs natively on your machine, allowing it
to interoperate natively with languages like C, as well as it's way of working makes integration with other codebases very easy.

Here's what it looks like:

```haskell
"NeoHaskell is cool"
  |> String.replace "cool" "awesome"
  |> String.toWordsList

-- > ["NeoHaskell", "IS", "AWESOME"]
```

As you can see in the example above, NeoHaskell favors **semantic and readable code** that is easy to understand, while providing tools that guide the developer towards a more maintainable solution.

By reading the code, it is easy to infer what it is doing. There's no need for code comments, because the code is self-explanatory.

You might have some questions already, don't worry about it. We will cover
every little detail in the rest of the docs. Just read along so you can have
a high-level understanding of what NeoHaskell offers.

:::info Prerequisites
The NeoHaskell documentation is tailored for beginners, but it does make some assumptions like familiarity with a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/),
at least some level of fluency with the terminal (like changing directories and executing commands), and at least that some other experience with coding
in general.

Many examples will be accompanied with a counter example in TypeScript, it is not a requirement to know TypeScript, but it helps as it is a good middle-ground to make an anchor for helping you
learn through similarity.

## A Batteries-Included Language

NeoHaskell is a language, a framework, and ecosystem that tries to aid in
software development for a wide range of fields. While some might argue that
it is not the best tool for each of those specific tasks, it for sure is the
one that makes the development process more enjoyable.

It could be possible that you are an experienced developer, and you have
an already working application. NeoHaskell allows you easily integrate it
into many applications, you can read more about it in the [Integrating NeoHaskell](/docs/extra-topics/integrating-neohaskell.mdx) page.

We all left a coding
project for a period of time and then found ourselves completely lost when
coming back into it. NeoHaskell mitigates that by adopting a strong opinion
on how stuff should be done, and in exchange, you get back a predictable
application that is easy to extend and maintain.

NeoHaskell aims to help you in fields as:

- Backend Development <Badge issue="40" />
- Command Line Scripting <Badge issue="39" />
- Website Pages <Badge issue="41" />
- Mobile/Desktop Apps <Badge issue="42" />

Those look like completely disconnected fields that don't have much in
common. In reality, the NeoHaskell way of working works well with all of
them, and makes everything a bliss.

NeoHaskell comes with a extensive core library that helps you with a wide
range of tasks like:

- File System Management <Badge issue="58" />
- Command Line Interfaces <Badge issue="59" />
- Create HTTP APIs <Badge issue="60" />
- Consume HTTP APIs <Badge issue="61" />
- Serialization for JSON and friends <Badge issue="62" />
- HTML Rendering <Badge issue="63" />

And much more! The NeoHaskell compiler allows you to produce optimized
builds that only have the required code that your app needs. <Badge issue="64" />

## A User-Centered Language

Everything in NeoHaskell is designed and implemented with the user in mind.
Therefore, everything is packed into the `neo` command line tool. <Badge issue="65" />

What is everything? Well, everything that you need for developing your
application:

- Installing NeoHaskell <Badge issue="66" />
- Generating a new project <Badge issue="31" />
- Generating commonly-shaped files <Badge issue="38" />
- Generating documentation <Badge issue="38" />
- Managing dependencies <Badge issue="32" />
- Compiling your code <Badge issue="31" />
- Linting <Badge issue="34" />
- Formatting <Badge issue="34" />
- Running your tests <Badge issue="33" />
- Packing your application for deployment <Badge issue="36" />

And every use case that helps you to be more happy along the way.

## Begin your Journey

This has been a high-level introduction into the language, now we will
roll up our sleeves and get our hands dirty. Happy hacking!

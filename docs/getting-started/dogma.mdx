# The NeoHaskell Dogma

> A Dogma is not bad if it is aligned with the principles of the individual, and flexible enough for the moments it isn't.

## The NeoHaskell Statements

* Beautiful is better than ugly
* Simple is better than complex
* Duplicate and easy is better than concise and complex
* Mathematics are good when not seen
* The 95% of type-safety should be done with 5-or-less% of the effort
* Instead of investing effort in the other 5%, better release to prod
* If it takes more than 15 minutes to understand, it's a bug
* The functional way is better, unless the imperative one is easier

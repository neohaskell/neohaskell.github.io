# Installing NeoHaskell

All of NeoHaskell's tasks are handled by the `neo` command line tool. You might think of it as the chosen one _(matrix pun, sorry)_.

`neo` will install all the required stuff for you, so you don't have to worry about it.

## Getting Neo

In order to install `neo` copy and paste the following command in your terminal (if you're on Windows, use PowerShell as Administrator):

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS">

```haskell
main :: IO ()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```haskell
main :: IO ()
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```haskell
main :: IO ()
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

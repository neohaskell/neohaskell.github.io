# Installing NeoHaskell

:::caution
The documentation that you're reading is a design document where most of
the features you're reading are yet to be implemented. Check the [Note on the Docs](/docs/docs-intro)
:::

All of NeoHaskell's tasks are handled by the **Neo** command line tool. You might think of it as the chosen one _(The Matrix™️ pun, sorry)_.

Neo will install all the required stuff for you, so you don't have to worry about it.

## Getting Neo

In order to install Neo, copy and paste the following command in your terminal (if you're on Windows, use PowerShell as Administrator): <Badge issue="66" />

<Tabs groupId="os">
<TabItem value="mac" label="MacOS/Linux/WSL2">

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.neohaskell.org | sh
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force;[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; try { Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock ([ScriptBlock]::Create((Invoke-WebRequest https://ps.neohaskell.org -UseBasicParsing))) -ArgumentList $true } catch { Write-Error $_ }
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

:::note
For many commands, Neo uses `git` under the hood. If you don't have it, you
can read a guide on how to install it
[here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Trying the Installation

Once everything is installed, usually the common thing is to try that
some commands do work. Let's do it the opposite way, let's try some
command that doesn't exist: <Badge issue="68" />

```text
$ neo learn-kung-fu

Neo: I'm sorry, I don't know how to `learn-kung-fu`.
     Try `neo help` to see what I can do.

     It looks like your last command failed. Remember, if it is taking
     you more than 15 minutes to figure it out, it is a bug in the system.

     Please go to:

     https://github.com/neohaskell/neohaskell/issues/new

     And report it. I'll be waiting for you.
```

Remember that, if you're having trouble figuring stuff out, and it is
taking you more than 15 minutes, we consider it a bug in the system.

Let's actually try the installation now by running `neo version`:

```text
$ neo version
v0.1.0
```

## Updating Neo

Neo is a very young project, so it is constantly changing. In order to
keep up with the latest changes, you can run `neo update:self`: <Badge issue="69" />

```text
$ neo update:self
Neo: Updating Neo...........................

     The Matrix feels different after this update.
```

## Using Neo Effectively

Neo is a very powerful tool, and it can do a lot of things. In order to
learn how to use it, you can run `neo help` to see all the available
commands: <Badge issue="70" />

```text
$ neo help
Neo: I'm here to help you.

     Usage: neo <command> [options]

     Commands:
       help      Show this help message
       version   Show version
       new       Create new things
       update    Update things
       build     Build things
       run       Run things
       watch     Run things on file changes
       clean     Clean the project
       install   Install a package
       uninstall Uninstall a package
       search    Search for a package
       list      List installed packages
```

What does these commands that say "things" mean? Well, they are
commands that have subcommands. If we run `neo run help`, we'll see
something like this:

```text
$ neo run help
Neo: I'm here to help you.

     Usage: neo run <command> [options]

     Commands:
       app       Run the application
       repl      Run the interactive console
       test      Run the tests
       format    Run the formatter
```

You can keep using the `help` command to see what each command does!

## Next Steps

Now that you have Neo installed, we're going to start getting our hands
dirty, with the Neo interactive console. Let's go to the next section!
